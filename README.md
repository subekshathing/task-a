## Setup Instructions

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/skeleton-list.git
    cd skeleton-list
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The project will be available at https://task-a-alpha.vercel.app/

## Technology Choices and Rationale

- **React**: Chosen for its simplicity and the ability to create reusable components.
- **Material-UI**: Provides a set of pre-styled components that are easy to customize, which speeds up development.
- **Framer Motion**: Used for animations, as it provides smooth transitions and is well-integrated with React.


## Known Limitations/Trade-offs

Performance: The app may experience performance issues when rendering too many items at once.
Responsive Design: Further work is needed to fully optimize for all screen sizes.

## Future Improvements

- **Improve Skeleton Design**: Enhance the design of skeleton loaders to make them more visually appealing.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Implement a more advanced infinite scroll pattern (e.g., pre-loading the next batch of items).


## Time Spent on the Project

- Initial Setup: 30 minutes
